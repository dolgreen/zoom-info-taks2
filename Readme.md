# explanation

    The mission is to build an algorithem that gets 2 | 3 arguments.
    
        - c => number of times the digit appear.
        - d => the digit
        - t (optional) => the target
    If there are two arguments it finds the smallest positive number that cannot be produced from my input.

    If there are three arguments then the program returns the equation that the program used to reach the target.
    If its impossible then it will return "{target} cannot be computed in..."
